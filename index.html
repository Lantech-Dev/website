	<h2>What is Lantech Games?</h2>
	<p>Lantech Games is a service for people of any age or ability to make or play games.</p>
	<h2>How can I get Lantech Games?</h2>
	<p>Currently Lantech Games is still under development. But, we urgently need games made by the community, so if you have any please upload your game <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Sy6l_4l7MUQ2QdTSVzdEBdrnv45AH8LQCtAPVxL5V4/">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>How can I upload my game and what are the requirements?</h2>
	<p>It's really easy to upload your game to Lantech, simply fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Sy6l_4l7MUQ2QdTSVzdEBdrnv45AH8LQCtAPVxL5V4/">google form</a>. The requirements are as follows:</p>
	<p>Your game must be either a .html file or .sb3 (scratch/turbowarp/penguinmod)file. Your game must also follow the <a href="developers.html#age guidelines">Developer guidelines</a> or we can't allow your game. Head to the <a href="developers.html">Developer tools</a> for more info.</p>
	<h2>What age do I have to be to use Lantech Games?</h2>
	<p>Anyone can use Lantech Games regardless of their age! Lantech Games is a community with a wide range of ages. However, if you are a parent and you are concerned about your child's online safety, there are a variety of tools in the app to limit games that your child sees based on age. This is only a recommendation; there is no legal requirement to limit games above a certain age group as all games should be suitable for children. Read the <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a> for more info.</p>
	<h2>Socials</h2>
	<p>We also have a Discord group that anyone can join (assuming you are above the age requirement for Discord in your region/country).</p>
