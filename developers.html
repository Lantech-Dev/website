		<h2>Developer requirements</h2>
		<p>1. Your game must be either a <code>html</code> file or an <code>sb3</code> file.</p>
		<p>2. Your game can't contain adverts inside it, as we don't like to edit people's code.</p>
		<p>3. Your game must meet the age guidelines listed below.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="age guidelines">
		<h2>Developer age guidelines</h2>
		<p>We have created a list of criteria to follow to keep our platform safe for all ages. While all games on Lantech are theoretically appropriate for all ages (assuming they don't have any content generally dissallowed for children), we have developed the ability for parents to limit what content their child is able to view and play. The following categories are for this reason:</p>
		<h3>Ages 8 and below</h3>
		<p>cartoon violence, NO mature content, NO drug references, NO references to real-life dangerous events, NO self-harm</p>
		<h3>Ages 9 to 12</h3>
		<p>mild violence, mild mature content (e.g. mild dating), NO drug references, NO references to real-life dangerous events, NO self-harm</p>
		<h3>Ages 13 and above</h3>
		<p>general violence (no extreme blood or gore), mild mature content (e.g. mild dating), NO drug references, NO references to real-life dangerous events, NO self-harm</p>
		<h3>In no cases should the following ever be allowed on Lantech Games:</h3>
		<p>Gambling, extreme violence, adultery, hate towards any religion, political group, nation, gender e.t.c. , general hate, extreme graphical content of any kind</p>
