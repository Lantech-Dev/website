# Monetisation/adverts

Currently, there is no way to monetise your game on Lantech. We also don't allow custom adverts in your game. However, you can make adverts for your game within Lantech Games when you upload your game [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Sy6l_4l7MUQ2QdTSVzdEBdrnv45AH8LQCtAPVxL5V4).

This may change in the future, so check back on this page every so often in case this changes.
