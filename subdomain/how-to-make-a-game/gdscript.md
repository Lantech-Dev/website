# GDscript and Godot

There is also a possibility of developing games through GDscript and Godot. We don't know as much about these as the previous listed, but it is definitely possible. You will need to export your game as a `.html` file though. You can access their documents at [https://docs.godotengine.org/](https://docs.godotengine.org/).
