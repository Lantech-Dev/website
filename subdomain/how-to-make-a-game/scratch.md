# Scratch

:::caution
Rules on Scratch are different to rules on Lantech; please do not mention us there, otherwise you may risk getting your Scratch account banned.
:::

You can use Scratch to create a game easily. You can visit Scratch at [https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).
We're assuming you're already familiar with Scratch - if not, then this opportunity probably isn't for you, sorry.
If you have made a game on Scratch, we reccommend further developing it on either one of the next two options.
