# Lantech Games documentation

Here you can find tools for developing games.

First of all, you'll need to actually make your game; we have provided a list of ways you can make your game. If you've already made your game using Turbowarp or Penguinmod, you can read onto the 'advanced integrations' section. If not, read the 'How to make a game' section.
